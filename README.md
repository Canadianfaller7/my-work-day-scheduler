# My Workday Scheduler

## Description
- This is a web application that allows the user to be able to see the current day of the week and what year it is, and are able to put in a task they need to accomplish between the hours of 8am-5pm. If the time is current, the text box will show up red for the user, if the time is in the future, the text box will be green, and if the time has already passed, then the text box will be grey. Once the user inputs a task, the task will be updated in their localStorage, so they may go back to the site as long as they don't clear their cache and cookies.

- As I went through this project, I was able to learn more about how to use jquery and to target css elements to be able to add the correct text and style I needed to get the form to display. I also learned how to interact better with an API to be able to get time and dates that I wanted displayed on the screen for the user.
